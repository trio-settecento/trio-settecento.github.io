"Some of the most refreshing, life-enhancing Baroque playing heard in years."
</blockquote>
<span class="tabbed">Chicago Tribune</span>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
Whatever the demands, the musicians ornament with stylish sensibility, savour the expressive sophistication, and achieve
utmost clarity of texture. Pine and Rozendaal use vibrato sparingly, while finding a spectrum of shadings to colour
phrases. With Schrader contributing his own brand of articulate and glistening artistry, the trio turns this delectably
considered soirée into an evening to cherish.

<p>
<blockquote>
French Soirée finds the Trio Settecento on ravishing form&hellip;Magic moments abound, most memorably the way Pine opens
the second section of the François Couperin Sarabande with a half-whispered sensuality that captures the change of mood
to perfection.
</blockquote>
<span class="tabbed">James Crel, <em>The Strad</em></span>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
Trio Settecento has changed the rules and set the bar rather high. As one critic who has, as my readers know,
consistently railed against streamlined, formulaic, or plain boring Baroque performances, I can attest that Trio
Settecento plays with tremendous warmth.

<p>
<blockquote>
The performances are expert&hellip;There’s that same sense of give and take, of knowing when to accompany and when to
lead, that good modern ensembles display.

<p>
<blockquote>
Throughout, the indelible rapport of the three players is delightful.

</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
Their playing is first-rate, and their discs sound superb&hellip;Performed on period instruments in the most-elegant
possible manner, the music is close to irresistible.
</blockquote>
<span class="tabbed">John J. Puccio, <em>Classical Candor</em></span>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
A gentle, close and almost 'protective' spirit pervades and informs  their sound, and sense of structure and
development - where the music is leading. Then, quite remarkably and without fuss or self-consciousness, they bring
the listener with them.  But not as a teacher leads a pupil. Much more in the way in which music-makers of eighteenth
century Germany must have ensconced themselves with their small and unpretentious (yet perhaps righteously expectant)
patrons, employers, and listeners.

<blockquote>
Trio Settecento proves that this music [Trio Settecento: A German Bouquet] was indeed a conversation among friends.
Rachel Barton Pine, John Mark Rozendaal and David Schrader create a musical environment that welcomes the listener to
discover music from centuries ago that they can really enjoy.
