All three members of Trio Settecento are dedicated to community engagement and music education. They are always eager to
work with students, reach new audiences, and share their enthusiasm about music with as many members of the public as
possible.

Please contact us to discuss planning an event tailored to the interests of your audience, community, or school. The
following are examples of Trio Settecento's outreach activities.
